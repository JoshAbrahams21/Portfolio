volatility) using the CoinMarketCap API.\n","- Uses sentiment analysis from the VADER model to gauge public opinion on cryptocurrencies.\n","- Implements technical indicators such as MACD, RSI, and SMA for feature engineering.\n","- Applies an ensemble machine learning model (Random Forest & Logistic Regression) with SMOTE to handle class imbalance.\n","- Simulates a trading strategy based on model predictions, incorporating dynamic thresholds and risk management
